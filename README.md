# TrackNow – Real-Time Location Tracking System

Built a full-stack real-time location tracking application using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Implemented Socket.io for live location updates and Leaflet.js for interactive map integration.

Designed backend APIs to manage and store user/device location data securely.

Added advanced features: create/join rooms for isolated tracking, live updates, mobile-responsive sidebar, and real-time UI feedback.

Developed a scalable architecture suitable for e-commerce order tracking, food delivery apps, ride-sharing platforms, and logistics systems.

Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.
